    This Fargettian Dictator over here is fast and dangerous. He's best tanked by a ranged unit like Maria or Clair, who can kite him and bait out his ridiculous instant Rush attack. Because he moves around a lot, he isn't terribly friendly to melee characters or invokers. That said, Myuria can cover such a huge range with Plasma Cyclone that it almost doesn't matter. Roddick is also notable because of his primary lightning damage and incredible stun ability.

    Jie's most common attack is his Rush, and he likes to open with it. So if you're the host, be ready to dodge as soon as you gain control, or you might take a cheap shot to the face.

    For all this, he'll go down fast, so you might not see his most dangerous attacks, but I'll document them anyway:

    When Jie enters Alert Mode, you'll have to worry about Unidentified Signal and Rocket Punch. Signal is aggravating because it comes out with little warning and the dodge window is small. You want to be ready to dodge repeatedly as soon as he hops to avoid the paralysis and damage. Rocket Punch is a rare attack that is easily avoided, and the least threatening of the two by far. You have literally an eternity to get out of the way when he fires his fists.

    Jie will signal his enrage with Annihilation Mode, and then continue his usual AI only his attacks do fatal damage. However, he will also perform Exploding Ground at fixed intervals. This can be handled by canceling it with a Rush Combo, or by dodging repeatedly at the edge of the stage during the explosion.
