    Attack pattern intensifies as its HP decreases. Susceptive to freeze and silence. In M2 and M3 Zinae gains a strong ranged attack that sends a wall of flame across the stage; stay in front of Zinae when it is activated. Zinae's companion Nightingales will use Faerie Healing to restore its HP, so it is recommended to defeat them first!
