    Alim/Gumi's poverty-inducing chain combo simulator finally makes its way to Star Ocean Anamnesis. Now it is time to do battle with some weird knight thing. Knight is high mobility and high damage, with a focus on limiting your own ability to counter-attack it. This encourages ranged units primarily, with an emphasis on flexible, high speed shooters like **Maria**, **9S**, **Nel**, **Clair** and **Vampire Viktor**.

    Flexibility is the name of the game, and so happens to be NieR. If you have **2B** or **A2** they are ideal in the attacker and defender roles respectively. Others that can contribute well are **Rain** (OMGGGG), **Phia**, **Devil Clair** and **Summer Myuria**. **Were-Millie** is especially notable for her ranged combo's high tracking, and her ability to nullify Slow fields.

    Casters trend towards being slow as molasses, so it's hard to recommend them, but **Myuria** and **Celine** can get around that weakness with wide-hitting AoEs. As much of Knight's damage is burst, it is similarly hard to recommend healers; **Fina** and **Rena** are the best bet, with **Summer Sophia** trailing third for her ability to nullify Slow Fields.

    Knight begins the fight with four mermaids. They run around flinging painful Ice Needles and Helmet Crushes, and that makes them too dangerous to leave alive. Thankfully, they don't have much HP. Unfortunately, Knight's docile phase can hardly be called docile. He is constantly using Static Storm, Pain Glaive, Knee Thrust and his fields to make clearing the stage as painful as possible.

    You'll want your kiter or defender to pick up Knight immediately and have the rest of the party clean house. For the easiest time, avoid burning him until the adds are clear, because once he uses Untapped Power things get a whole lot worse. **Rodeo Spin is especially deadly for melee** so don't think you can just tank it. Likewise, **Hurricane Beam comes out super fast**, so watch for the name and be ready to dodge--it's all too easy to get caught and killed before you can react.

    In Misery 2 and higher, his "docile" phase now includes most of his movepool, which alongside the mermaids, is not a welcome change. The strategy remains the same here, but **field nullification becomes more important with Chaotic Aerial Flash invoking Slow Fields**. This fight is all about reading his movements and dodging fast, so practice makes perfect.

    Run down the timer and he just starts doing millions of damage. If you play FFBE or Brave Frontier, this probably won't phase you.

        Raises its sword high and then performs a horizontal slash that deals damage. A purple field will appear on its red target and gather dark energy. After one second, it will explode. Knight regains control before the explosion.

      targets: Close
      m1: true
      m2: true
      m3: true
      desc: >
        Dashes towards its target, then leaps away and charges them, knocking them into the air. After, it will thrust upward at an angle dealing high damage.

        Points its sword high and generates a sequence of gray (AP Null/Slow) fields in a line formation across the stage. This lingers for about 3 seconds. On M2+, this generates two sequences, each lasting 3 seconds; first is a Y formation across the stage, then the familiar line formation.

    - name: Attack Field Expansion
      targets: Any
      m1: true
      m2: true
      m3: true
      desc: >
        Points its sword high and generates four red (damage) fields in a cross formation. M2+ these fields get bigger.

      m1: true
      m2: true
      m3: true
      desc: >
        Will power up with purple energy, indicating the end of its docile phase. Enables Rodeo Spin (M1 Only), Hurricane Beam (M1 Only), 5-Hit Aerial Flash (M1 Only) and Air Slash Retaliation.

    - name: 5-Hit Aerial Flash
      targets: Any
      m1: true
      m2: true
      m3: true
      desc: >
        Will hold its helmet for 1 second, then five line markers will appear on the ground in a spread formation from it. After another second, air slashes will travel down the lines in the order from its right to its left.

    - name: Rodeo Spin
      targets: Close
      m1: true
      m2: true
      m3: true

        Will perform a ready pose for one second then do a cyclone slash, damaging everyone around it.

        Casts a wind blast that crosses the stage, dealing flinch damage in a wide area. Lingers.

    - name: Long Range Aerial Flash
      targets: Any
      m2: true
      m3: true

        This is 5-Hit Aerial Flash, but the line markers begin at mid-range instead of close range.

    - name: Chaotic Aerial Field Slash
      targets: Any
      m2: true
      m3: true
      desc: >
        This begins much like Aerial Flash, except he will launch projectiles at three opposing ends of the stage. The projectile opposite him will spawn five lines, which after one second fires the air slashes from left to right. As those fire, one of the other projectiles will spawn their line markers and while that is firing its air slashes, the third will spawn its final markers. The knight regains control during the second projectile's air slashes so beware. On M2+, this will be combined with Distortion Field Expansion.

    - name: Untapped Power Released

        Will power up with purple energy. This is a sign that Exiled Knight has enraged.
