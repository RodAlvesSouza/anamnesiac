    The factors aren't going to blow you away. They're strong enough though. But the biggest thing is that even on JP this is the only
    light imbue greatsword. On top of that it's one of the only limited time weapons in the game. So if you missed it, well check out the
    other greatswords for options.

  notes: >
    A decent greatsword for A2 and future greatsword wielders especially if they're defenders. The lifesteal helps with sustain. A good 
    neutral option if you missed out on Beastlord.

  notes: >
    Isn't that strong a greatsword. It has passable factors, but those factors just don't make up for the lack of stats it has unlike 
    the factors durandal has. On top of that, the third factor is seen on multiple accessories now. Safe to use as fodder if you have
    Durandal.

  notes: >
    If you didn't get beastlord, this is probably the best pick for your A2 unless you prefer the extra sustain of Durandal. Boosting
    your hardest hitting move and giving increased AP recovery is good. On top of that it has gacha level stats.
