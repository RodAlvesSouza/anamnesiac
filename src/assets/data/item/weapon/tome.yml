    If you don't have a tome don't worry, this one is pretty good and can be used on any tome wielder you happen to get. Boosting your
    INT helps make up for the lack of stats, it has a decent regen buff, and the crit factor is nice to have if you have no crit
    buffing in your party.

    The bad tome of the coin shop, also the only one in the transmute pool. Please make it a coin for the other actually good tome.

    The event weapon for Valentine Welch. It's okay for her, boosts rush damage which is rare, reduces damage taken which is nice.
    Boosts her main damage skill, but for anyone other than her, or if you obtain any better tome, it's fodder.

    An exceptional tome for Valentine Welch and won't do bad in the future for any dark wielding tome caster. It's inbuilt stun boost
    as mlb factor is nice and a good grit chance is always welcome. A must keep if you get it.
