    This is the weapon meant for Faize. Please give it to Faize or you'll never be able to actually use Faize because every other bns

    A neutral weapon with good synergy for Victor, the ATK buff makes up for the stat loss, it boosts his best attacking move and the
    extra taunt helps him hold aggro. It's also good on Princess Miki for this reason as well.

    A well statted weapon with an imbue that's easily obtained. You want this, even if the second factor is bad, it's a stat stick
    helping you contribute to elemental burst and doing even more damage to fire weak enemies.

    One hell of a BnS. An elemental imbue weapon with a pretty big lifesteal effect. At MLB it gives some defensive benefit if you have
    aggro but the first two factors are good enough on their own.

    An ice imbue BnS. It's pretty good as well since it's ATK bonus makes up for the lack of stats. If you happen to get it to MLB you
    also gain a good life steal boost which is a nice bonus. A must have for your BnS collection.
