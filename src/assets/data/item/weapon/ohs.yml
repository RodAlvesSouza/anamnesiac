    A good weapon if you just started, it's 3rd lb factor is a strong one and it's ATK buff makes up for it's lack of stats. A decent
    neutral weapon if you need one.

    A limited weapon and a fantastic weapon for 2b and also Fayt. Great mech hate, big lifesteal bonus and a good mlb factor. Buffing
    your attribute damage is what makes it particularly good on fayt and 2b but it's a pretty solid neutral weapon at mlb especially
    against mech bosses.

    A good pick from the ohs exchange. A light imbue sword, one of three in the game but the easiest to obtain. You're using this
    purely to bring light imbue, but that's a good enough factor on it's own since it already has a decent ATK stat to make it a
    good weapon.

    It's a better version of the Lightning sword, especially at MLB. It has more stats, buffs Roddick's rush and has a defensive

    An amazing sword, elemental imbue and the only lightning sword even on JP. It's 2nd factor is strong if you don't have Roddick
    and the third factor is exceptional if you're not playing a role which wants aggro. Thought it's first two factors are plenty
    strong enough to make use of it.

    Not a bad neutral weapon considering it gives two types of race hate buffs. It's other two factors are also nice ones to have.
    Very good if you're playing Fayt or 2B and to a certain extent Roddick. Worth keeping just to have a nice neutral weapon if it's
