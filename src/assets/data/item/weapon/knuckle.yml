    Knuckles intended for Rena. Due to Rena's unique nature as a healer who uses knuckles and casts spells these are actually pretty
    good for her, boosting her damage spells and adding a little bulk. They're fodder otherwise.

    A decent pair of knuckles for a new player, the ATK buff makes up for the lack of stats. It has some additional synergy with Cliff
    if you want him, but contributing to elemental burst will always be better.

    A good neutral weapon for Cliff as it gives him even more self buffs and buffs one of his attacks. That being said contributing to
    elemental burst is probably better in higher difficulty content so it's your decision on if it's worth keeping or not.

    While earth is probably the worst element, if the enemy doesn't resist it, then it's all okay and you're contributing to elemental
    burst which is the important part. A couple of characters have Triple Kick so it's a slight bonus and the GL stat buff means Rena
    can use them for what it's worth. Not a bad idea to get these if you don't have the gacha earth knuckles.

    Okay knuckles for Anne but they're actually best put on Michael, they best his talent based Fire damage dealt by 5% so it gives him
    a slight boost on his skills. Other than that, they're pretty bad and shouldn't be chased or exchanged for.

    They're a worse version of the bloody knuckles. The saving grace is perhaps that as I write this there are 8 knuckles users and
    5 of them have Crescent Locus so there's some synergy there. But it's pretty much just trash.

    The Bloody Knuckles on steroids and the knuckles every Rena main wants. It's INT buff makes it a must have if you want to play a lot

    for other knuckle users you're using it as a neutral anti-human weapon for.

    Basically the Fanged Knuckles but with better machine hate and fire imbue instead of a skill damage boost. These knuckles are now
    very good since as imbue isn't often paired with slayer in GL, especially with this big a slayer bonus. You'll really mess up
    any fire weak machines with these and they're just decent all around knuckles. The final factor is pathetic though.
