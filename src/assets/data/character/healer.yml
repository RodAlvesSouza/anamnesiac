      _After managing to avoid the nerf hammer almost entirely, sSophia boasts an incredibly useful kit. She is able to feed AP to her party as she casts her DMG spells, with her -AP costs she is actually able to spam a fair bit. She is great for hitcount generation, which really helps out her sluggish Rush Gain, and also helps out units like sMyuria, being able to get to 100+ hit count very fast. Her actual damage itself is decent as well, and gets higher with her gacha weapon. She can fit in pretty much every party, and especially syncs well with caster parties due to her INT post rush buff, however her unique buff also allows her to help out any party composition. Don't let her role fool you, she is very offensive for a healer, and a very good unit overall._

      _[v2] Not much to add here so everything still applies. She gets some minor improvements to her self buffs. Her most important party buff wasn't touched, so she's just slightly more competitive for her quick heals and damage output._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Offensive spells restore AP to the party.
      
      - Post rush buff that's powerful for self and other INT characters.
      
      - High damage. Especially for a healer.
      
      - Orb wielder, makes her less clunky and laggy compared to her staff counter parts.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Weak standalone heal. Highly depending on weaving it into her rotation for effectiveness.
      
      - This means the AI will suck with her. Hard.
      
      - Lightning Wave has a max range which can make it awkward to use.
      
      - Below average rush build.
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *L - Wave has a max range, be careful with using it from max distance*

      *Normal > Strike > Faerie > Strike^n*

      *Normal > Strike > L - Wave >  Strike^n - 102 ~ 103 AP Required*

      _The only healer with zero passive benefits to the party, offensively or defensively; she's strictly a healslave. Being a one-trick-pony tends to mean she isn't an attractive long-term choice. She does, however, boast incredibly potent party regen via her rush and high rush gain, making her a decent option for survival and particularly solo content so long as you can afford the loss in firepower._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so is cheaper to max limit break and augment

      **Cons**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats

      _A buff-oriented healer suited for melee parties like her SO2 cohorts. Extremely fast casts, amazing Guts percentage and Angel Feather (20% buff to all stats). Notable for the fact that Angel Feather buffs stack with all other buffs (additively in battle with stuff like Fidel [Ex: 40 + 20% after AF = 60% in battle ATK]).  If you want a healer who provides good party buffing for melee and is hardy as all hell, Rena's your girl. She is a fist user, so be careful with your positioning. Her Rush Gain is notably a bit slow, and does require her to hit her DMG spell or suffer by spamming heal._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Fast cast times
      
      - Talents and post rush buff that is amazing for melee compositions
      
      - Hard to kill
      
      - Angel Feather stacks with all party passive buffs.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Low damage
      
      - Slow rush gain, unless you put yourself in danger by meleeing the boss
      
      - Melee range normals
      
      - Offers little to ranged characters
      
      - Radiant Lancer's damage and rush gain are backloaded onto the final hit, which sucks for especially mobile bosses
       
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Lancer VS Laser - Preference. You'll never reach more than 200% Faerie Light, so running Lasers lets you do faster rotations. However, Lancer does give a slight amount more damage.*

      *Angel Feather - Buff, reapply as necessary.*

      *Faerie Light^n - Healing and Rush Gain*

      *(Normal >) Lancer > Faerie > Lancer - If you're comfortable doing a close range normal.*

      _Actually our first significant GL exclusive buff, putting her more in line with other healers. Her rush gain and cast times are still abysmal, but it actually does feel usable. Be careful, as her cast times are not to be understated - you can definitely feel the length of her spells, and they will put you stationary for a lengthy time (it also means you have to pick the spell you cast wisely). Ideally your team shouldn't be in the position to die with a healer, but in the case it happens, you'll put them right back on their feet. Slight INT buffs if you happen to be with a caster, and a slight damage buff in the form of rush damage._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Can revive party members by rushing
      
      - Powerful post rush self buff that gives insane healing and damage
      
      - Consistent damage
      
      - Buffs INT and rush damage
      
      - Hard hitting rush compared to most healers
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Abysmal rush gain
      
      - Lack of powerful buffs for the party
      
      - Lack of a good talent that helps survivability

      _Discount Rena for ranged units. She's an non-ACE, which means lower stats but easier LBs, so it's a decent trade-off. Her main goal is to throw Angel Feather on the team and exist. However, being another staff unit with no cast-time redux means that her rush gain and heal timing will both be a bit slow. It's likely that a team will consistently need to 3-rush without her due to having to spend time with AF upkeep. Minor benefits to ranged units like Maria, who enjoy the AP recovery. Minor cleric, for specifc status effects._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so is cheaper to max limit break and augment
      
      - Immunity to Poison and Paralysis.
      
      - Her rush is an excellent clutch heal and includes party cleanse.
      
      - Grit talent makes her hard to kill.
      
      - Angel Feather stacks with all party passive buffs.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - 5 star non-ace so has less stats
      
      - Slow cast times, staff casting animation and ridiculous AP costs makes clutch healing very difficult.
      
      - Angel Feather actively interferes with her reliability due to its lengthy cast time & AP cost.
      
      - Slow rush gain
      
      - Poor damage
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Angel Feather - Buff, reapply as necessary.*

  notes: >
      _Comes with a number of uncommon buffs, though unfortunately thanks to 9S's existence, her mobility is not absolutely unique anymore. That said, she cuts cast time for everyone, including herself, at even a higher rate than most self-buffs. AP battery with crit rate/damage buffing, overall a very reasonable filler for anyone wanting to play a Healer or missed / doesn't like SSophia. Postrush she gives her crit rate buff without the hitcount, and regen for Nier comps helps with not needing to actively sustain them._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**


      - Strong buffing, inc. movement buffs, hit count buffs and an excellent post-rush buff.
      
      - Grants AP to the party when using offensive spells.
      
      - Great invoking time reduction for the party.
           
      - Hit count timer extension gives good synergy with hit count characters.


      **Cons**

      - Staff animations
      
      - High animation lock; struggles against fast moving targets.
      
      - Sacred Lancer's damage and rush gain are backloaded onto the final hit, adding insult to injury.
      
      - Lack of AP reduction talent
      
      - Lack of talent to help surviability

      _The smol is here. As a main healer she's not bad, the regen to all allows her to focus on reapplying buff without worrying as much about her teammates, and helps maintain chip damage for 100HP conditionals. Additionally, she applies buffing on her heal, and then has a combo buff which can be applied manually. She benefits both caster and attacker parties, while also bulking a bit when lacking ATK damage down specifically._

      _[Potential] - Relia is uniquely good at being an autohealer, consider that her buff is paired with her heal, both her rush gain and buffing are not gimped. Just make sure you don't equip any attack skills, or she may waste time._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
     
      **Pros**
      
      - Both Faerie Light and Brute Englightenment (INT only) buffs stack with all passive party buffs, which is impressive utility.
      
      - Faerie Light having a Growth buff baked in makes it so much easier to maintain.
      
      - Talents that cover many of the AI's worst flaws in single player parties.
      
      - One of the most future proof characters in her niche.
      
      - Great invoking time reduction.
      
      - Rare single target DMG buff on her rush.
      
      
      **Cons**      
      
      - Staff animations and high AP costs.
      
      - Abysmal damage, among the worst in the game.
      
      - Attempting to maintain both Brute Enlightenment and Faerie Light really screws her rush gain.
      
      - Brute Enlightenment is a dead spell in most comps, and horrible in AI hands. Unequip it immediately for single player.
      
      - Low natural surviability.


      **Rotation**   
     
      - Enraging Faerie Light (Healing)
      
      - Normal > Enraging Faerie Light > Radiant Lancer/Aurora Rings ("Damage" rotation, best for rush gain)

  notes: >
      _Fina bundles up everything that we've gotten in a healer all in one. She has a half buff compared to Angel Feather, AP battery, heals of course, and crit on rush. Unconditional super armor means F1/2 mobs can't interrupt her, nor can minor boss attacks (or even big ones), which can be useful for tanking through boss attacks as long as you survive the initial hit. Minor cast time buff and increased AP given on Aim compared to JP are nice QOL changes._
      
      **TL DR**


      **Pros**

      - Cheer is a very powerful buffing skill
      
      - Grants AP to the party when using offensive skills
      
      - Great personal invoking time reduction.
           
      - Not elemental locked, can wield imbue weapons


      **Cons**

      - Has Bow AI
      
      - Not a great AP battery compared to other healers
      
      - Lack of AP reduction talent
      
      - Lack of talent to help surviability


      **Rotation**
      
      *Cheer - Buff, reapply as necessary.*

      *(Normal > Aim) > Curaga - Feed/Healing*

      *Normal > Aim^n - Rush Gain/Party AP Feeding, the general spam you'll be doing when not healing or buffing.*

      *Normal > Aim > Shower > Aim^n - If you're planning on dropping Curaga to be a AP battery bot with HC and some sort of DPS contribution.*

      *10% AP reduction can allow chains using Cheer > Aim and ensures a 5th Aim.*

  notes: >
      _A fairly unique healer, due to her buffing and rush buff. DEF down is subpar as always, but it's a bonus which can increase DPS when lacking crit, so it's not all bad. Paired with the still uncommon ATK/INT Damage pre-rush and a unique damage taken to help finish bosses faster, she's actually quite a respectable buffer for the team. Unconditional casting superarmor tops this off, which will help her maintain her buff and heals._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
     
      **Pros**
      
      - Built in AP reduction and self INT and HP buffs.
      
      - Deals good damage compared to other healers.
      
      - Decent buffs that boost ATK & INT damage.
      
      - Super armor while casting.
      
      - Tome Caster
      
      - Strong de-buffs
      
      
      **Cons**      
      
      - Earth locked.
      
      - Lacks traits to help surviability beyond a HP buff.
      
      - Her good buffs won't age well.
      
      - Doesn't bring any combat buffs or AP feeding unlike other top healers.

      - Normal > Gluttony Bog > Earth Glaive Infatuation > Gluttony Bog  (Damage rotation)

  notes: >
      _[v2] Subpar awakening. GL got some buffs which allow her to do what she does already, and awakening doesn't really fix any of the issues that she began with. Although her rush and cast time is a bit better, it's still slow and revive, while it sounds cool, persists in being a crutch. Ideally no one should die, but in the case where you expect someone to, it will come in handy. Minor stat buffs and higher self regen + antiflinch casting allow her to take some riskier plays / positioning, but nothing crazy here._

      _[Potential] - Eve's value goes up in extremely difficult fights with less experienced players. She does have the fairly unique ability to completely save a doomed run, though this is dependent on the skill of the player. What Eve brings to a fight is consistency in having your teammates alive, but at the cost of slowing down the fight - she really doesn't do damage, so you really need to be wary of enrage._
      
      
      **TL DR**
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Can revive party members by rushing
      
      - Powerful post rush self buff that gives insane healing and damage
      
      - Consistent damage
      
      - Buffs INT and rush damage
      
      - Hard hitting rush compared to most healers
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Poor rush gain
      
      - Lack of powerful buffs for the party
      
      - Lack of a good talent that helps survivability

      **Rotation**
      
      *(Normal >) Lancer/Comet^n - Rush Gain, Lancer or Comet depending on target.*
      
      *Normal > Comet > Faerie - More potent healing w/ Rush Gain*

  notes: >
      _[v2] If it looks unimpressive, it kind of is. Element damage pre-rush is slightly more common, though still a fairly rare pre-rush stat, and crit damage only applies upon her rush, in an average amount. Pair that with not getting a cast redux buff at all, and even awakened Millie gets the full brunt of staff-casting spells. Her main saving grace is her new party buffs, regen, at a decently high amount, and partywide guts, which is her biggest selling point. Her new spell clerics ailments, but it only hits one person and ailments (especially only hitting some of the party and not all of them) are situational, especially considering the cost of casting spells due to time._

      _[Potential] That said, Millie is what she looks like. On manual in particular and in some cases auto, possibly, she may be good for certain difficulties, making it pretty damn hard for your party to die. In 6 seconds, guts can refresh, and if she does get rush, she does contribute pretty heavily to damage._
