      An incredible unit. Boasts amazing overall party utility, bringing a strong ATK buff, unconditional AP recovery on normal attacks (unlike Summer Reimi), and an incredible post-rush buff to the party. Her air dodge and evasion talents give her fluidity in a fight. Alongside all her utility, her actual damage is very solid.    
      
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong party-wide ATK buff and post-rush elemental damage buff.
      
      - Unconditional AP recovery on normal attacks for the party.
      
      - Can air dodge and has cheaper evasion costs.
      
      - Innate light and dark imbue.
      
      - While her most optimal DPS is at melee, her ranged skills give her flexibility.
      
      
      **Cons**

      - ATK buff is conditional on maintaining full HP.
      
      - Self-imbue can be a downside against enemies with elemental resistances.

      Fidel, the starter character and sometime face of the app. Fidel's 40% unconditional party-wide ATK buff is still reasonable, but he gives no AP recovery from normals, which limits his utility as an ATK buffer compared to units like 2B and Halloween Millie. His personal damage is not stellar, though this is mitigated to some degree by his AP reduction talent and potent post-rush buff.     
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong party-wide ATK buff.
      
      - Passive AP reduction talent and even more reduction post-rush allows skill spamming.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Brings no party utility beyond his ATK buff.
      
      - Low ATK stat gives him lower damage compared to competing units.

  notes: >
      Awakened Fidel got a JP-side stealth buff, making his Air Raid much more consistent, as well as eliminating some other clunk attached to the move. With this, he now deals a significant amount of damage, allowing him to function reasonably as both an ATK buffer and a carry. A solid team comp would still need to build around him (ideally adding AP recovery somewhere), but he allows flexibility and eliminates the need to rely on meeting at times fussy conditionals in order to maximize damage.    
      

      [Potential] With his changes, Fidel becomes a pub hero, bringing his own buffing and extremely good DPS. That said, he still suffers in premades, but will do particularly well on auto, where his particular strengths shine (Air Raid hits easily, doesn't rely as heavily on AP normals, non-conditional buff).   
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong unconditional party-wide ATK buff.
      
      - Passive AP reduction talent and even more reduction post-rush allows skill spamming.
      
      - Has ranged skills which give him more flexibility.
      
      - Air Raid has high rush gain, for easy 20-second rush-chaining.    
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Doesn't bring any party utility beyond his ATK buff.

  notes: >
      Great for solo content, with dirt-cheap AP costs and a powerful rush. Notably, Fists of Fury's multi-hits linger when canceling the move, allowing Cliff to avoid committing to it and rapidly build hit count. Main weakness is that his buffs are all selfish, meaning that he brings little party utility and depends heavily on party buffs to optimize his damage output. Cliff is outscaled by other carries, and will continue to fall behind until his awakening.   
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Powerful when party comp is built for him.
      
      - Good for solo play.   
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Completely selfish buffs; zero utility for the party.
      
      - No ranged attack.
      
      - No post-rush buff.

      Buffs critical hit chance, but brings little other party utility and has low damage output. Niche use in Crystal Guardian and against high DEF targets.   
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong passive party-wide crit buff, as well as an unmatched post-rush crit buff.
      
      - 5-star non-ace, therefore costs less to limit break and augment.     
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - 5-star non-ace, therefore has lower stats.
      
      - Poor damage and little utility beyond crit buffing.

  notes: >
      His main niche is potent AP reduction; he passively provides the party -20% AP costs, ramping up to -40% post-rush. This can facilitate building rush more quickly for the party, making sub 20-second rush rotations effortless in some cases. However, he brings less utility to invoker/healer parties, as many invokers and healers already have AP reduction talents/buffs.    
      

      His DPS is brought up to above-average levels if able to utilize his humanoid slayer talent. Later on, there will be units with high DMG/AP cost skills that will benefit more from his passive.     
      
      
     
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Powerful party-wide AP reduction buff.
      
      - Good damage against humanoids.
      
      - 5-star non-ace, therefore costs less to limit break and augment.   
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - 5-star non-ace, which means he has less stats.
      
      - Doesn't bring any utility beyond his AP reduction.
      
      - Unimpressive damage against non-humanoids.

  notes: >
      Buffs stun rate for the party, and boasts an amazing, albeit selfish, post-rush buff. Being able to chain-stun trivializes bosses, allowing the party to unload on them without worrying about dodging. His effectiveness falls off in fights that can be ended in a single rush, so save him for content durable enough for post-rush buffs and multiple stuns to matter. Best kept away from humanoid bosses, as his performance drops sharply if Shotgun Blast and Dragon Slash can't get bonus hits. Is still relevant today even in JP due to his ability to stun; a fantastic unit.   
      
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Powerful party-wide stun buff.
      
      - Strong post-rush buff.
      
      
      **Cons**

      - Brings little party utility beyond his stun buff.
      
      - Team comp needs to be built around him to some degree.

      Unnerfed to her JP glory, albeit way before summer officially swings back again. Her buffing becomes competitive, with an unconditional 45% ATK buff, and her AP on normals goes back to 100%, though only for melee (admittedly a bit unfortunate). She also gets air dodge, making her Helmsplitter much more usable [SUMMER SMOOTHIE]. SReimi returns. Although her moveset is still a bit subpar, there's nothing particularly terrible about it.     
      
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong party-wide ATK buffs.
      
      - Ap recovery on normals for short-range fighters.
      
      - Really powerful post-rush buff.
      
      - Rush combo damage buff.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Slow rush gain.
      
      - Awkward positional conditionals.
      
      - Somewhat subpar moveset.

  notes: >
      Lenneth is a direct side-downgrade from ATK buffers like S.Reimi and Fidel. Her damage and rush gain are nothing to write home about, and you lose the convenience of normal attack AP recovery for melee units in exchange for a chance to silence. Silence may occasionally stop a boss pattern from doing something annoying (or it can promote a more dangerous pattern). 
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Unconditional party-wide ATK buff.
      
      - Rush combo damage buff.
      
      - Debuffs enemy DEF on rush, a relatively uncommon post-rush buff.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Many other ATK buffers bring stronger buffing.
      
      - Silence is unreliable and only situationally useful.
      
      - Unimpressive damage and rush gain.

  notes: >
      Claude is an interesting unit; he buffs ATK for Attackers and Defenders while mitigating damage for Healers. His ATK buff is now outscaled by awakened Fidel (who buffs all classes), but notably he does give unconditional AP on normals to his party, which is his biggest draw. Unfortunately, there are now so many other options that Claude is not the optimal choice even when teamp comp can be built around him.
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong unconditional ATK buff for Attackers and Defenders.
      
      - Damage reduction for Healers.
      
      - Party-wide AP recovery on normals.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Poor synergy with Sharpshooters and Invokers.
      
      - Post-rush buff made redundant by commonly seen units like Maria and 9S.

  notes: >
      Ranged Cliff, and should have similar performance. Her buffs are selfish, with no party utility to speak of besides the potential for Freeze (which only guarantees a single crit). She has a good skillset and her buffs aren't common pre-rush, which means they don't overlap as much with Maria/S.Miki and other crit buffers. Don't get hit, as she has a -20% DEF penalty on top of her already quite low innate DEF. Her strong passive crit buff makes her particularly useful against enemies with high DEF like Crystal Guardian.
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - High damage output.
      
      - Good skillset.
      
      - 5-star non-ace, therefore costs less to limit break and augment.
      
      - Strong passive crit buff.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Selfish buffs; provides no party utility.
      
      - 5-star non-ace, therefore has lower stats.      
      
      - Squishy.

  notes: >
      A bit interesting, though on GL release will not be as stellar as he was on JP. In general, stronger weapons and better access to certain buffs mean that Albel, while being a decent carry/buffer hybrid, doesn't do either extremely well. His damage is gated by his focus on Air Slash, and like Claude his main ATK buff only applies to Attackers and Defenders. Unlike Claude, however, he does not give AP recovery on normals, and his DEF reduction matters little with weaker enemies, only adding a minor damage increase. That said, he does deal decent damage post-rush and racks hitcount well with Aura Wall.
      
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Decent variety of buffs.
      
      - Good post-rush damage.
      
      - Rare enemy debuff.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Squishy post-rush.
      
      - Buffs are easily made redundant.
      
      - Not the best skillset.

  notes: >
      Ilia is meant to synergize with Invokers on maps with fodder, but realistically most maps which have mobs don't really need the multi-target damage, and most bosses come alone otherwise. For the exact composition she would support (Invokers who deal fire damage) her ATK buff is useless. Overall extremely poor synergy. If you have no other ATK buffer, she fills the role, but literally any other ATK buffer will probably do the job better. Her moveset is subpar and neither of her large skills are worth the cost for what they do.   
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - 5-star non-ace, therefore costs less to limit break and augment.
      
      - Unique party-wide buffs.
      
      - Passive AP reduction.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - 5-star non-ace, therefore has lower stats.
      
      - Buffs aren't really that relevant outside of niche comps and content.
      
      - ATK buff is overshadowed by many other ATK buffers.

      H.Clair makes off with the weakest of the unnerfs, only getting a slight increase to ATK and her ATK damage buffs. That said, this brings her back in line with current levels of power, making her damage extremely solid. She is still a reasonable source of ATK damage, especially pre-rush, and her post-rush buff isn't terrible, bulking while also adding a smidge of extra damage.
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - High damage output.
      
      - Reasonably rare post-rush buff and debuff.
      
      - Built in AP reduction.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Quite squishy, especially pre-rush.
      
      - Rush gain could be better.

      Awoo makes her great return, with excellent unconditional buffing and a very reasonable 100-hitcount requirement for max buffing. Notably, her conditionals are less strict than 2B's, since the team is not required to maintain full HP. Her damage buff unnerf puts her back to reasonable levels.

      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Strong party-wide buffs.
      
      - Hitcount conditionals are more forgiving than HP conditionals.
      
      - Niche but useful talent that nullifies movement and rush reduction fields for her party.
      
      - Flexible skillset, can accomodate melee or ranged combos.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Rush gain could be better.

      The boy himself, who should have been a decent ATK buffer, was unfortunately powercrept before his release. Although he comes bundled with a few choice buffs, overall his lower ATK buff and lack of AP recovery on normals makes him comparatively less appealing. That said, he is a fairly reasonable unit, with his elemental damage buff making up a bit for his weaker ATK buffing. He also comes with a free double imbue and gives a slight anti-flinch to ranged units.
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Decent ATK buff.
      
      - Double self imbue.
      
      - Passive party-wide elemental damage buff.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - His self imbues may be a disadvantage against enemies with elemental resistances.
      
      - His anti-flinch talent is often made redundant by overriding buffs from other party members.

      Convince your teammates to die for you. Michael is an interesting character, with the unique ability to become stronger as your teammates die. Unfortunately, he suffers from long animation skills and subpar buffs. His +40% to ATK would be nice but it's only for Attackers, and he's at his strongest when he has no other teammates, which is unintuitive; in addition, his long skills hinder kiting and make soloing difficult. Worth noting that he does count towards his own buff, and it persists through revives, whether by gems or Healers like Eve.
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Unique design.
      
      - Solid ATK buff for attackers.
      
      - Deals decent damage.
      
      - Strong against fire-weak bosses.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Skills with long animations.
      
      - Needs party members to die to be at his most effective.
      
      - Needs elemental imbue weapons if enemy resists fire.

      Hitcount-based carry who can support himself even with no other ATK buffer present. Respectable hitcount racking on his main skill. Quick-deploying long range skills make him easy and safe to play at range. The mobility of his skills will take getting used to, but can be used to avoid many attacks mid-combo, with the caveat that you may sometimes need to drop a combo chain to avoid moving in a dangerous direction. His personal rush buff lasts basically indefinitely once he gets it the first time, due to the 30 second timer.

      
      **Pros**
      
      - Brings a lot of damage.
      
      - A carry who brings some utility to the party.
      
      - Fast, mobile skills which can be used to dodge mid-combo.
      
            
      **Cons**
      
      - Skills change his positioning, which can move you into an attack.
      
      - His hitcount requirements may be difficult to readily meet in some comps.

      Troll 4* unit which became a 5* unit in GL. Notable for being one of the few units with DEF down, which is, however, largely useless due to the existence of crit. She can grief allies, so if you see her, prepare to take more damage. She does give a decent ATK boost to the party post-rush, at the cost of the huge DEF down.
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Adds a challenge to runs.
      
      - Uncommon DEF debuff to enemies.
      
            
      **Cons**
      
      - DEF debuff to party members.
      
      - Low damage.

  notes: >
      A selfish carry similar to Cliff, but unlike Cliff actually does give some minor party buffing. Should be slightly stronger, and also scales a bit better with hitcount. Not amazing compared to the limited carries, but should be reasonable for a while, especially as a permanent unit.
      
      

      **Pros**
      
      - Does a good amount of damage, especially when her hitcount conditionals are met.
      
      - Gives some party buffing.
      
   
      **Cons**
      
      - Like all carries, needs heavy support from team buffs to be at her optimal.
      
      - Hitcount conditionals may be difficult to meet in some comps.

      Free Fidel. He actually has solid ATK buffing, with some minor other benefits; in a sense, he's probably actually close to discount Claude. Overall he's a great attack buffer for anyone who doesn't have one already. Solid even compared to some units we have already. Minor talent buffs, significant multiplier buffs compared to his JP version, making him more viable damage-wise too.
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Reasonable party-wide unconditional ATK buff.
      
      - Solid unconditional ATK buff for melee weapon users.
      
      - Free MLB ace unit.
      
      - Deals good damage.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Does little for ranged characters.
      
      - Gives no AP recovery on normals.

  notes: >
      A carry with a rare debuff. Interesting party utility as well, giving significant AP cost redux at skill chain >3; it may be hard to work around this as an ally, but she can maintain it for a few seconds due to her low AP costs. Her skills are notoriously slow and her rush gain can be unreliable, so consider this the tradeoff for her buffs. Monster rush.
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - High DPS.
      
      - Unlike many carries, brings some party utility.
      
      - Rare enemy debuffs.
      
            
      **Cons**
      
      - Slow skills.
      
      - Rush gain can be an issue, since her slow skills can easily miss mobile targets without careful timing.
      
      
      **Rotation**
      
      *Normal > Magnetic > CA Arm > (Rocket/Magnetic)^n*

      *All of vVerda's skills can be CA'd for repositioning. Rocket and Magnetic can come down to preference. Magnetic Field has a longer animation time, but can be better with mobile and small targets due to higher area coverage.*

      V.Rena is hard to value. On one hand, she doesn't have AP recovery for anyone but Attackers. On the other hand, she has the highest unconditional ATK buff in the game for melee units. Paired with a carry or an Attacker with AP recovery, she is amazing. However, 2B (the best ATK buffer at time of writing) gives equal albeit conditional ATK buffing along with unconditional AP on normals, and is easier to build around.

      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Solid unconditional party-wide ATK buff.
      
      - Very strong ATK buff for melee units.
      
      - Strong and unique buffs for Attackers.
      
      - Powerful post-rush buff.
      
      - Passive guts.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Gives little support to non-Attackers.
      
      - AP recovery on normals only for Attackers.
      
      - Her post-rush buff, though strong, is often redundant with a Defender in the group.

      Melee X.Fidel. Has her own ATK buff, a very high base ATK, and some respectable buffing for melee units. She also comes with innate crit at 100% HP. Otherwise a pretty standard carry with some good self-sustain. Nothing particularly special about her. Does have disruption during EB, so be careful. 
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Varied buffs that are quite strong.
      
      - Deals high damage.
      
      - Post-rush regen gives her self-sustain.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Conditional buffs that either need to be built around or are fussy to maintain.
      
      - No ranged attacks.

      Ashton's party buffing looks pretty bad, and that's because it is -- he's a carry, so don't be fooled. Pre-rush elemental damage helps him make the most of his imbued skills, and as a bonus he basically has two free imbues. Hitcount racking, a bunch of cool self-buffs for using his rotation, and a solid post-rush. Other carries may bring more, but he's a solid force to be reckoned with.
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Passive party-wide elemental damage buff, which is still uncommon.
      
      - Strong post-rush buff.
      
      - Deals good damage.
      
      - Good ranged and melee skillsets.
      
      - Fun playstyle.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - His elemental damage buff overlaps with the post-rush buffs of a number of commonly used units.
      
      - Hitcount conditional may be difficult to meet in some comps.

      B.Rena is a spread buffer who suffers from subpar buffing. That said, her GL exclusive buff gave her AP on normals, which is one of the most important buffs for most parties. This sets her as a sidegrade to H.Millie, with a notable bonus being her regen, which is enough to recover a significant amount of health before rush. Her moveset is quite bad; her version of Fists of Fury (Chariot) cannot be canceled, unlike Cliff's, and none of her other skills do notable damage, though her personal buffs make up for this somewhat.


      That said, she does a decent job in pubs. She gives AP on normals and an average ATK buff, brings single target damage and limited anti-flinch, and sustains the party. In essence, she substitutes for three roles in one slot, which is pretty good.
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Party-wide HP regen.
      
      - Gives party-wide AP recovery on normals.
      
      - Big rush multiplier.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - ATK buff is low compared to buffers like 2B, H.Millie, and V.Rena.
      
      - Several of her buffs, including her post-rush buff, are made redundant if a Defender is in the group.
      
      - Awkward moveset.

      In real talk, she's pretty below average. Mostly unimpressive damage, especially compared to limited carries, with almost non-existent buffing otherwise. Her party-wide HP regen is not useful enough to merit alloting her a team slot for that purpose. Outscaled even without considering the GL level of powercreep. Her only saving grace is some decent multipliers in addition to her selfish buffs.
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Solid skill multipliers.
      
      - Strong rush.
      
      - Party-wide regen on post-rush.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Unimpressive ATK stat paired with a conditional self buff.
      
      - Utility is quite weak.

  notes: >
      As a pure carry, Crowe's damage isn't bad. He's fast, fun, and incentivizes rear attacks for extra power. His rush looks a bit strange, but it gives him a high DPS burst (and its low duration means you only need to get off the one combo). To add onto this, he brings his own ATK buffing and conditional AP recovery on normals, making him a good choice for pubs.
   
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Deals good damage.
      
      - Fast, accessible playstyle.
      
      - Self-sufficient to a degree, bringing his own ATK buffing and AP recovery on normals.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Low rush multiplier, especially for a carry.

  notes: >
      Our final non-ace release, and she has a single niche as a utility unit -- rush feeding, which will be unique to her until the arrival of some future units. Functionally, she does what Daril does, trading extra 300% combo damage for slightly more rush uptime and sub-20 rush rotations (which can benefit from rush buffs). She deals terrible damage by herself, but her post-rush damage buff is notably higher than that of any Sharpshooter except for Cherry Blossom Dias's conditional passive. Rising Dragon feeds 5% rush bar regardless of character and whether it hits or not. She also gives party-wide AP on normals, though locked behind an HP conditional.
   
      
      
      **Pros**
      
      - Unique rush-feeding ability.
      
      - Strong post-rush damage buff.
      
      
      **Cons**
      
      - Underwhelming as an ATK buffer, with very weak ATK buffing and AP recovery locked behind an HP conditional.
      
      - Deals unimpressive damage.

  notes: >
      Awakened, Lenneth is as underwhelming as she was on her original release. Although she has more aggregate buffing, they're very unimpressive buffs, and her personal damage is decent but not amazing. Silence is a laugh for the specific bosses it works on, but when it doesn't, 1/3 of her buff kit is completely useless. She is an adequate damage/ATK buffer combo unit in pubs thanks to slightly better numbers, but otherwise has no particular merits.

  notes: >
      _"Dead Ends things harder than some characters rush for." Even with all the strange GL releases, Arngrim brings one of the highest DPS numbers to date, with fairly fast and extremely powerful rotations. DEF down is not amazing, but when lacking innate crit, does come in handy, and is almost guarnateed to be unique in a party. His main shortcoming is that he needs to CA to achieve maximum output, but mitigates this with a huge 95/30 guts. In a pinch, he does have a heal on holding his CA (just charge and don't release) but it takes 6 seconds to achieve guts % HP back, making it very situational. Postrush guaranteed crit makes him a great choice for high difficulty content to bust through the inflated stats._

      _Innately does Light/Fire damage.  Buffs both ATK and attribute damage, but his ATK buff is low and his attribute buffing isn't unique.
      Awakening similarly didn't boost his skills by as much as it needed to; he takes a lot of investment for a subpar ATK buffer._

      **Pros**
      
      - Decent ATK buff
      
      - Double self imbue
      
      - Passive elemental damage buff
      
      - Awooo
      
      
      **Cons**
            
      - Has no ranged attack
      
      - Needs certain weapons against bosses with elemental resist
      
      - His anti-flinch is pretty useless at this point
